# Minimal Bank Application

This is a minimal bank application, that simulates usual transactions in a real world internet bank service, e.g. visualizing current account status and movements, money transfer, account closing, and loan requests. The program itself is a reconstruction/adaptation/extension of an original application developed by Jonas Schmedtmann and it is developed entirely with HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
